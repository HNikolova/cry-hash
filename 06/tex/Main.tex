\section{Differential Cryptanalysis of Variants of CubeHash}

\subsection{CubeHash*}

We introduce a MSB-difference in the $1^{st}$ word of the internal state ($w_1$).

\begin{itemize}
    \item First $\boxplus$ will propagate the difference with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item First $swap$ won't do anything.
    \item First $\oplus$ will propagate the difference to the word $w_{16}$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Second $swap$ will move the difference to the MSB of $w_3$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Second $\boxplus$ will propagate the differences $w_1$ and $w_3$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Third $swap$ will move the difference to the MSB of $w_{21}$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Second $\oplus$ will propagate the difference to the words $w_{17}$, $w_{19}$ and $w_{21}$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Fourth $swap$ will move the difference to the MSB of $w_4$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
\end{itemize}

Finally, with propability $Pr = 1$, the MSB of $w_4$, $w_{17}$, $w_{19}$ and $w_{21}$ will be flipped. If not flipping the MSB, each $\boxplus$ will introduce a $Pr = 0.5$ for each flipped bit in their input. This would lead to a final propability of $Pr = 0.125$. Obviously, the security is significantly decreased regarding to differential cryptanalysis. Regarding to symmetric states: They are still possible.

\subsection{CubeHash**}

We introduce a MSB-difference in the $i^{th}$ word of the first 16 state words of the internal state ($w_i$).

\begin{itemize}
    \item First $\boxplus$ will propagate the difference with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item First $\lll$ won't do anything.
    \item First $\oplus$ will propagate the difference to the word $w_{i+16}$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Second $\boxplus$ will eliminate difference in $w_i$ with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Second $\lll$ moves difference to $11^{th}$ position with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item Second $\oplus$ won't do anything.
\end{itemize}

Finally, with propability $Pr = 1$, the $11^{th}$ bit of $w_{i+16}$ will be flipped. If not flipping the MSB, each $\boxplus$ will introduce a $Pr = 0.5$ for each flipped bit in their input. This would lead to a final propability of $Pr = 0.25$. Obviously, the security is significantly decreased regarding to differential cryptanalysis. Regarding to symmetric states: They are still possible.


\section{Differential Cryptanalysis of BLAKE}

\subsection{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce MSB-differences in the following input variables: $a$, $M_0$ and $M_3$.
    \item After the first round, there is no difference left with propability $Pr = 1$.
    \item The second and third round will introduce no new differences.
    \item The last round introduces the following differences:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a'$: MSB with $Pr = 1$
        \item $b'$: $15^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 1$
        \item $c'$: $8^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 0.5$
        \item $d'$: $8^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 1$
    \end{itemize}
    \item This leads to a total propability of 0.5
\end{itemize}

\subsection{}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce MSB-differences in the following input variables: $M_2$ and $M_3$.
    \item The first differences are introduced in the third round. They lead to differences in the four intermediate chaining values:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a'$: MSB with $Pr = 1$
        \item $b'$: $28^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 1$
        \item $c'$: $16^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 0.5$
        \item $d'$: $16^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 1$
    \end{itemize}
    \item In the last round these differences are propagated through the structure, leading to the following flipped bits in the final chaining values:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $a''$: $28^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 0.5$
        \item $b''$: $3^{th}$ bit, $11^{th}$ bit and $28^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 0.5$
        \item $c''$: $4^{th}$ bit, $16^{th}$ bit and $24^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 2^{-5}$
        \item $d''$: $4^{th}$ bit and $24^{th}$ bit with $Pr = 0.5$
    \end{itemize}
    \item This leads to a total propability of $Pr = 2^{-8}$
\end{itemize}

\section{Differential Cryptanalysis of Skein*}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Introduce MSB-differences in the $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ block.
    \item After one round this leads to MSB-differences in the $1^{st}$ and $3^{rd}$ block.
    \item After second round there are MSB-differences in the $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ block again.
    \item After 72 rounds there will be MSB-differences in the $2^{nd}$ and $4^{th}$ block with propability of $Pr = 1$.
\end{itemize}
