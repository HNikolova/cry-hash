                    & \textbf{Yes.} Since $C_1$ and $C_2$ are known and $E$ is invertible
                    & \textbf{No.}  $M_i$ is contained in both: Key- and plain-text

                    & \textbf{No.} Knowledge on $H_{i-1}$ or $H_{i-1}^*$ does not help here
                    & \textbf{No.} Because $M_i$ is in the key
                    & \textbf{No.} Because only $H_{i-1}$ is used as input for $E$
                    & \textbf{Yes.} For $M_i^* = M_i \oplus H_{i-1} \oplus H_{i-1}^* $
                    & \textbf{No.} Since the block cipher's key differs for $H_{i}$ a call to the oracle is needed
                    & \textbf{No.} Because $M_i$ is in the key

                \textbf{Backward}
                    & \textbf{Yes.} $M_i$ can be computed directly. Every assumed $H_{i-1}$ will be correct
                    & \textbf{No.}  Because $H_{i-1}$ is xor'ed with the cipher-text
                    & \textbf{Yes.} Assume an Key $k = M_i \oplus H_{i-1}$ and calculate $H_{i-1}$ by inverting $E$. Get $M_i$ by solving the former equation

                \rowcolor{Gray} \textbf{Fixpoint}

                    & \textbf{No.}  One has to solve $E_{M_{i-1}}(H_i) \oplus M_i = 0$ which is only possible in $O(2^n)$
                    & \textbf{No.}  Because $M_i$ is part of the key
                    & \textbf{No.}  $M_i$ is contained in both: Cipher- and plain-text
                    & \textbf{Yes.} Assume an arbitrary value for $H_{i-1}$. Calculate $M_i$ by solving $0 = E_{H_{i-1}}(M_i \oplus H_{i-1})$
                    & \textbf{No.}  It's not efficient to find a $M_i$ such that $E_{M_i}(M_i) = 0$

\subsection{The Security of the compression Function}

\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{Collision-security:} Collisions can be found with a birthday attack, yielding $O(2^{2n/2}) = O(2^n)$.
    \item \textbf{Preimage-security:} Preimages can also be found in $O(2^n)$: Retrieve a $H_{i-1}$ and a $G_{i-1}$. Calculate $M_i = E_{H_{i-1}}^{-1}(H_i)$. Then calculate a $G_i^* = E_{G_{i-1}}(M_i)$. If $G_i^*$ equals $G_i$ a preimage has been found. Else choose another triple Since $G_i$ has n bits, the propability is $1/2^n$.
    \item \textbf{2nd-Preimage-security:} $O(2^n)$ as well. First request the result of the desired image, then apply the preimage-approach.
\end{description}

\subsection{The Security of the Hash Function}

\begin{description}
    \item \textbf{Collision-security:} Since $H_0$ is fixed and $E$ is invertible it is impossible that different $M_1$ collide.
    \item \textbf{Preimage-security:}  Due to the invertibility of $E$, it's easy to calculate $M_1 = E_{H_0}^{-1}(H_1)$
    \item \textbf{2nd-Preimage-security:} As there are no collisions with this structure, no 2nd-preimages exist.
